/**
 * This class is a workaround for a bug (or edge case behavior) in the FetchJoinORMAdapter or better the used Paginator
 * and CountOutputWalker.
 * If the query contains multiple GROUP BY clauses, the result of the count query is wrong, as some lines are counted
 * multiple times. This is because the CountOutputWalker does not use DISTINCT in the count query, if it contains a GROUP BY.
 *
 * We work around this by removing the GROUP BY clause from the query, and only adding the first root alias as GROUP BY (the part table).
 * This way we get the correct count, without breaking the query (we need a GROUP BY for the HAVING clauses).
 *
 * As a side effect this also seems to improve the performance of the count query a bit (which makes up a lot of the total query time).
