# Labels

Part-DB support the generation and printing of labels for parts, part lots and storage locations.
You can use the "Tools -> Label generator" menu entry to create labels or click the label generation link on the part.

You can define label templates by creating Label profiles. This way you can create many similar-looking labels with for
many parts.

The content of the labels is defined by the template's content field. You can use the WYSIWYG editor to create and style
the content (or write HTML code).
Using the "Label placeholder" menu in the editor, you can insert placeholders for the data of the parts.
It will be replaced by the concrete data when the label is generated.

## Label placeholders

A placeholder has the format `[[PLACEHOLDER]]` and will be filled with the concrete data by Part-DB.
You can use the "Placeholders" dropdown in the content editor, to automatically insert the placeholders.

## Twig mode

If you select "Twig" in parser mode under advanced settings, you can input a twig template in the lines field (activate
source mode). You can use most of the twig tags and filters listed
in [official documentation](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/).

The following variables are in injected into Twig and can be accessed using `{% raw %}{{ variable }}` (
or `{% raw %}{{ variable.property }}{% endraw %}`):

| Variable name                              | Description                                                                         |
|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `{% raw %}{{ element }}{% endraw %}`       | The target element, selected in label dialog                                        |
| `{% raw %}{{ user }}{% endraw %}`          | The current logged in user. Null if you are not logged in                           |
| `{% raw %}{{ install_title }}{% endraw %}` | The name of the current Part-DB instance (similar to [[INSTALL_NAME]] placeholder). |
| `{% raw %}{{ page }}{% endraw %}`          | The page number (the nth-element for which the label is generated                   |

## Use custom fonts for PDF labels

You can use your own fonts for label generation. To do this, put the TTF files of the fonts you want to use into
the `assets/fonts/dompdf` folder.
The filename will be used as name for the font family, and you can use a `_bold` (or `_b`), `_italic` (or `_i`)
or `_bold_italic` (or `_bi`) suffix to define
different styles of the font. So for example, if you copy the file `myfont.ttf` and `myfont_bold.ttf` into
the `assets/fonts/dompdf` folder, you can use the font family `myfont` with regular and bold style.
Afterward regenerate cache with `php bin/console cache:clear`, so the new fonts will be available for label generation.

The fonts will not be available from the UI directly, you have to use it in the HTML directly either by defining
a `style="font-family: 'myfont';"` attribute on the HTML element or by using a CSS class.
You can define the font globally for the label, by adding following statement to the "Additional styles (CSS)" option in
the label generator settings:

```css
* {
    font-family: 'myfont';
}
```

## Non-latin characters in PDF labels

The default used font (DejaVu) does not support all characters. Especially characters from non-latin languages like
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Cyrillic, etc. are not supported.
For this, we use [Unifont](http://unifoundry.com/unifont.html) as fallback font. This font supports all (or most) Unicode
characters but is not as beautiful as DejaVu.

If you want to use a different (more beautiful) font, you can use the [custom fonts](#use-custom-fonts-for-pdf-labels)
feature.
There is the [Noto](https://www.google.com/get/noto/) font family from Google, which supports a lot of languages and is
available in different styles (regular, bold, italic, bold-italic).
For example, you can use [Noto CJK](https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk) for more beautiful Chinese, Japanese, 
and Korean characters.
