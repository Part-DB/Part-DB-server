# Part-DB

Part-DB is an Open-Source inventory management system for your electronic components.
It is installed on a web server and so can be accessed with any browser without the need to install additional software.

{: .important-title }
> Demo
>
> If you want to test Part-DB without installing it, you can use [this](https://demo.part-db.de/) Heroku instance.
> (Or this link for the [German Version](https://demo.part-db.de/de/)).
>
> You can log in with username: **user** and password: **user**, to change/create data.
>
> Every change to the master branch gets automatically deployed, so it represents the current development progress and
> is
> maybe not completely stable. Please mind, that the free Heroku instance is used, so it can take some time when loading
> the page
> for the first time.

## Features

* Inventory management of your electronic parts. Each part can be assigned to a category, footprint, manufacturer
  and multiple store locations and price information. Parts can be grouped using tags. You can associate various files
  like datasheets or pictures with the parts.
* Multi-Language support (currently German, English, Russian, Japanese and French (experimental))
* Barcodes/Labels generator for parts and storage locations, scan barcodes via webcam using the builtin barcode scanner
* User system with groups and detailed (fine granular) permissions.
  Two-factor authentication is supported (Google Authenticator and Webauthn/U2F keys) and can be enforced for groups.
  Password reset via email can be setup.
* Optional support for single sign-on (SSO) via SAML (using an intermediate service
  like [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) you can connect Part-DB to an existing LDAP or Active Directory server)
* Import/Export system
* Project management: Create projects and assign parts to the bill of material (BOM), to show how often you could build
  this project and directly withdraw all components needed from DB
* Event log: Track what changes happens to your inventory, track which user does what. Revert your parts to older
  versions.
* Responsive design: You can use Part-DB on your PC, your tablet and your smartphone using the same interface.
* MySQL and SQLite supported as database backends
* Support for rich text descriptions and comments in parts
* Support for multiple currencies and automatic update of exchange rates supported
* Powerful search and filter function, including parametric search (search for parts according to some specifications)
* Easy migration from an existing PartKeepr instance (see [here]({%link partkeepr_migration.md %}))
* Use cloud providers (like Octopart, Digikey, farnell or TME) to automatically get part information, datasheets and
  prices for parts (see [here]({% link usage/information_provider_system.md %}))
* API to access Part-DB from other applications/scripts

With these features Part-DB is useful to hobbyists, who want to keep track of their private electronic parts inventory,
or makerspaces, where many users have should have (controlled) access to the shared inventory.

Part-DB is also used by small companies and universities for managing their inventory.
